### When selecting an open-source tool, what characteristics should you look for?

The characteristics we should look for when selecting an open-source tool is:

* License: The software's licensing terms determine how you can use, modify, and distribute it. Ensure the license aligns with your project's requirements and usage intentions.

* Community: A vibrant and engaged user community is crucial. It signifies regular usage, contributions, and issue resolutions. Such a community can also provide valuable support when needed.

* Features: Evaluate whether the tool offers the features you need. Make a list of your specific requirements and compare tools to find the best fit.

* Maturity: Consider the tool's maturity, which reflects its longevity and testing. More mature tools tend to be stable and reliable, while newer ones might be more innovative. Decide based on your project's priorities.
