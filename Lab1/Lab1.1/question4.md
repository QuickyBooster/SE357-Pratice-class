Advantages:

- Communicating with Customers and Other Stakeholders: 
    Knowledge-acquisition and knowledge-sharing processes that enable the exploration of stakeholdersâ€™ needs, the application domain and possible technical solutions;
    Iterative processes that allow the reshaping of this understanding throughout the entire project; 
    Effective communication and coordination processes that support the first two types of processes listed.

- Document Sharing and Version Control: Cloud-based tools facilitate the sharing and version control of requirement documents, ensuring that all team members have access to the latest information. This reduces the risk of working with outdated or conflicting requirements.

- Traceability: Requirements management tools can provide traceability features, making it easier to link and track requirements, changes, and their dependencies, even in a distributed environment.

- Automation and Notifications: Requirements tools often offer automation features like notifications and alerts for changes or updates to requirements. This helps ensure that all team members are informed promptly.

Drawbacks and Challenges:

- Communication Barriers: Despite the availability of communication tools, language barriers, cultural differences, and varying time zones can still hinder effective communication and understanding among global teams.

- Security and Privacy: Sharing sensitive requirement information over the internet or cloud platforms can raise concerns about data security and privacy, especially when dealing with confidential or proprietary data.

- Synchronization and Consistency: Ensuring that all team members are working with consistent and synchronized requirements data can be challenging. It's important to establish clear processes and procedures for managing changes.

- Technical Challenges: Global teams may face technical issues, such as differences in network connectivity, access to specific tools, or compatibility issues, which can impact collaboration and productivity.

- Cultural and Time Zone Differences: Different cultural norms, work styles, and time zones can create challenges in scheduling meetings, setting expectations, and collaborating effectively.

- Lack of Physical Presence: The absence of face-to-face interactions can result in a lack of personal connection and understanding among team members. Building trust and rapport can be more challenging in a distributed setting.

- Overreliance on Tools: Overreliance on tools may lead to a lack of critical thinking and the opportunity to engage in direct, in-depth discussions, which can be essential for understanding complex requirements.

- Training and Familiarity: Team members must be proficient in using the chosen tools, which may require training and time for adaptation, potentially slowing down the requirements engineering process initially.

- Complexity and Costs: Implementing and maintaining a suite of tools for distributed requirements engineering can be complex and costly, particularly for smaller organizations or teams.
