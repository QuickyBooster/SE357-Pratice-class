### How is AI being proposed for knowledge acquisition and representation in requirements specifications?

AI is being proposed for knowledge acquisition and representation in requirements specifications through the following approaches:

* Speech Understanding Methodology: This technique involves AI's capability to "listen in" on conversations during the requirement gathering process. It can collect stakeholders' declarations and convert them into a distinct vision. This method aims to reduce human intervention in requirements gathering.

* Automatic Keywords Mapping: AI techniques, like automatic keyword mapping, are used to enhance requirements elicitation. By automatically mapping every keyword spoken by stakeholders, it helps in recognizing essential terms and concepts used by stakeholders, thereby improving the clarity of requirements.

* Case-Based Reasoning: Case-based reasoning is explored as a means to assist in requirement elicitation. It can reduce the challenges related to natural language understanding and save time for requirement experts by leveraging past cases as references.

* Machine Learning for Sentiment Analysis: Machine learning algorithms are used to identify user preferences based on their sentiment. This approach helps in understanding the emotional tone of user feedback and comments, allowing for insights into user needs and requirements.
